			Cash-flow is referred to a person has no fluid assets to pay debt at due date, but can pay the debts
			through selling owned assets. Thus, negotiation to extend due date with appropriate terms on paying certain penalty is the best approach.
			While, balance sheet insolvency is referred to a person or a company doesn't own enough assets to pay the debt.
			One of the common resolutions is declaring bankruptcy. In many occasion negotiations can resolve the issue without entering bankruptcy.
		<h2>Issue</h2>

			Insolvency is a complex issue, as the causes are diverse and the trajectory of a person experiencing insolvency varies.
